# **Programming for Social Scientists- Agent Based Modelling**

This repository shows Python code that was produced during an intensive 1 week programming course at the Univeristy of Leeds. The main purpose of this module was to familiarise students with basic Python programming language, where the end result was the production of an Agent Based Model (ABM).
 
 ### What files are in this repository? 
 1. Model.py - Main file of code. 
 1. AF.py - Giving agents a key defined set of rules to determine their behaviour. 
 1. in.txt - The environment agents will interact with.

### How to run the code 
1. The code was produced in Spyder as part of the Anaconda navigator terminal. 
1. The Agent Framework.py and Model.py file from the repository can be copied onto Spyder.
1. These models are customizable and you can change of agents, the iterations and the number of neighbourhoods to your own desire.
1. Please note "tkinter" will be needed under the Graphics Backend on the python console. Save your two files and reset Spyder. 
1. Type "%matplot qt" into the console to allow for annimations and run the Framework and Model. 
1. Click "Model" and then "Run Model". 
1. The ABM will be produced.
